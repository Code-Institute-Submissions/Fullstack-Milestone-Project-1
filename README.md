Find Your Artifact is a single ecommerce web page built with
python and the django framework which saves the data to the postgresql
database app on heroku. The user can register,login,reset-password and
purchase an artifact from start to finish. The site is easy to navigate 
with a simple layout and is responsive on mobile and desktop.
