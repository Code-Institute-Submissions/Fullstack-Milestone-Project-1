## By Stephen Whittington

The survey from Travis says:
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/StephenWhittington/Fullstack-Milestone-Project.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/StephenWhittington/Fullstack-Milestone-Project)

(Pull requests will be ignored. This is an educational project and needs to remain a solo effort.)

Find Your Artifact is a single ecommerce web page built with
the django framework that saves data to the postgresql
database app on heroku, along with python and the stripe
api for submitting payments. The user can register,login,reset-password and
purchase an artifact from start to finish. The site is easy to navigate 
with a simple layout and is responsive on mobile and desktop. 

## UX Process

[Link to my figma mockup](https://github.com/StephenWhittington/Fullstack-Milestone-Project/blob/master/static/images/Find%20Your%20Artifact.png)

I started with a desktop mockup using figma by focusing on the core aspects
of what the user should experience, a well responsive and easy to use webpage.
With easy navigation, saving data forms that tell the user when and where
they can do things. My datbase design was to start with registering a user
then allowing them to log in and only checkout if authenticated, Also
being able update their customer profile and add artifacts to the basket.

The user wants to be able to view the artifacts and add them to the basket
but be required to register and log in if they want to go any further.
The site is built with easy navigation and layout so the user can easily
navigate around it without any issues.

### User Stories

#### **list of user stories.**

* **Register a User**: The user clicks on the register link or redirect from the login
page, it takes them to the registration page where they fill out the mandatory fields click
register then saves their details to the database and logs them in.

* **User Login**: An existing user can click on the login link enter the information
they registered with and it will log them into the page.

* **logout**: A user can logout via the link in the navbar, which then logs
the user out and their basket will be empty if they had anything added.

* **Create/Update Customer Profile**: when the user clicks on the customer link if
they havent added any details the button 'add details' will be seen that takes them
to a form to add them. Or if a user has added details already they see the
'edit details' button if they want to update their shipping details.

# Features 

## Existing Features

* **Responsive nav/sidebar** - A responsive and easy to use navbar that collapses into a side bar when screen is viewed
on mobile.

responsive design on mobile and dekstop.

## Features Left To Implement 

* Adding one to one user links between customer details and checkout form

### How it looks/works on different browsers and screen sizes

My project runs smoothly on all screen sizes mainly due to the impact
of the bootstrap column design and bootstrap forms. I tested the page
on the three most common web browsers Chrome/IE and Mozzila Firefox and i am happy
with how it looks.

## Compatibility

To make sure users have a broad range of accessibility, i have tested my project on 3 major browsers in both desktop and mobile size.

* Chrome
* Mozilla Firefox
* Internet Explorer

## Bugs And Problems

I havent come across any bugs yet but more problems with adding different apps to my project
but due to time frame, I havent got enough time to add them before submission which is why i have
focused on the core aspect having a user sign up and purchase an artifact with no errors.

I have had a problem with the django testing framework when i try to do my tests i get an 
error. I understand how to do automated testing but havent had chance to implement them,
so i have done most of my tests manually.

    * **Got an error creating the test database: permission denied to create database**

But apart from those parts above my project runs fine without any major errors.

# Deployment

My source code was all done via GitHub, You can find my repository here:
    
* **Repository**:[https://github.com/StephenWhittington/Fullstack-Milestone-Project](https://github.com/StephenWhittington/Fullstack-Milestone-Project)

The deployment and live version is hosted via Heroku:

* **Heroku**:[https://find-your-artifact.herokuapp.com/](https://find-your-artifact.herokuapp.com/)
    
    * First I created a new app and named it and set the region. 
    
    * Then I logged into heroku via git with `heroku login` and connected git to the new app location using
    `heroku git:remote`.

    * I then created a `requirements.txt` and `Procfile`:
        
        * `sudo pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`
        * `echo web: gunicorn ecommerce.wsgi:application > Procfile`
    
    * Then added all my project files using `git add .` and commited with `git commit -am "make it better"`
    
    * The project was then pushed using `git push heroku master` and scaled the app dynos using `heroku ps:scale web=1`.
    
    * I then went to Heroku settings clicked on Config Vars and added my
     `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, DATABASE_URL, EMAIL_ADDRESS,EMAIL_PASSWORD, HOSTNAME_HEROKU, SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE and STRIPE_SECRET`.
    
    * These are also ignored and hidden by a `.env` file in my workspace.
    
I can confirm that there are no differences from the deployed and the development version.

## How Developers can download and work on my project

    * Click on Clone or Download on my repository.
    * Create your own enviorment variables  
    * Clone the project in your workspace using git clone
    * Devs can also link it with gitpod if you use the `gitpod.io#` url or browers extension.

# Credits
 
 **Content**

 For this project i decided to go back to bootstrap 4 as the inbuilt form views
 suited for this type of ecommerce web page. Becuase of the time frame i decided
 to focus mainly on the customer experience from start to end. My CSS styling
 remained simple as i used the same class objects, but maintained a responsive
 and easy readable page. Any problems i encounted during the project i went to slack
 or contacted tutor support and also tried to sorce the answer myself.

  **Acknowledgements**

I received inspiration for this project from the django ecommerce mini project,
I then built the project using my own idea instead of the examples given
and i feel like i understand python,django,stripe a lot better now using it based off my own inspiration.

A huge thanks to my mentor Ignatius Ukwuoma for his time, suggestions, and constructive feedback for this project!
